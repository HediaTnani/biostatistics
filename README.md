# A free biostatistics reading list :)

## Fisher's Classics
- R. A. Fisher, *The Design of Experiments*, 1935 (Book)

  - Contains Fisher's famous lady-tasting tea experiment, first example I know of permutation testing, many groundbreaking examples of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and some disparaging (and very funny) remarks towards Pearson.

## Modeling proportions data (in the 0-1 interval)
- Beta regression

  - Foundational papers
    - Kieschnick & McCullough, *Regression analysis of variates observed on (0, 1): percentages, proportions and fractions*, 2003 (https://doi.org/10.1191/1471082X03st053oa)
    - Ferrari & Cribari-Neto, *Beta Regression for Modelling Rates and Proportions*, 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1080/0266476042000214501)
    
  - Regression tools

      - The paper accompagnying the R package betareg
    - Kubinec, *Ordered Beta Regression: A Parsimonious, Well-Fitting Model for Continuous Data with Lower and Upper Bounds*, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.20)
      - A paper proposing an alternative to the Zero-One Inflated Beta (ZOIB Model)
    - Zhang, Qiu & Shi, *simplexreg: An R Package for Regression Analysis of Proportional Data Using the Simplex Distribution*, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v071.i11)
